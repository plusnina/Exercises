# Exercises

### ex_2 is modified to assert that the submitted results are coherent, though I did not add more tests.

### ex_3 checks the existence of a gif with #cute, if nothing returned = passed, else the assertionError shown.

### Using selenium and time libraries only, could do implicitly_wait() instead of the time.sleep() but newer version of selenium is not my friend at this moment. This I might update a little later today.
